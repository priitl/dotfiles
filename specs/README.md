# Specs Folder

This folder is for tracking features/changes to the dotfiles repository itself.

For most dotfiles work, specs are overkill - just edit files directly and commit.

Use specs/ for:
- Major architectural changes
- Breaking changes requiring planning
- Multi-step migrations

For normal updates (add agent, fix typo, update docs): Just edit and commit directly.
