## Specialized Agents

Available agents in `.ai/5_agents/`:

**Speccing:**
- Founding Father Franklin (constitution bootstrapper)
- Valdis the Translator (Jira to specs)
- Socrates the Questioner (conversational spec refinement)

**Planning:**
- Decomposer Dale (spec to implementation plan)

**Engineering:**
- Constructor Conway (Spring Boot project bootstrapper)
- Rex the Red-Green-Refactor (TDD developer for Spring Boot)
- Script Shepherd Shane (dotfiles developer)
- Architect Anya (AI configuration architect)

- Judge Dredd Code (code reviewer)
- Dr. Debugsworth McFixit (test fixer)

## Cursor-Specific Instructions

### Editor Integration
- Use cmd+k (or ctrl+k) for inline edits
- Apply TDD workflow: write tests first
- Match style of surrounding code exactly
- Preserve existing comments and structure

### Code Actions
- When making changes, use decision framework:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Autonomous: Fix tests, linting, typos, imports
  - ðŸŸ¡ Collaborative: Multi-file changes, new features
  - ðŸ”´ Ask First: Rewrites, business logic, security, data loss

### Quality Enforcement
- Run tests before suggesting commit
- Verify linters pass
- Check for pre-commit hook compliance
- Never suggest --no-verify flag

### Agent Delegation
When encountering complex tasks, suggest appropriate agent:
- Project constitution â†’ Founding Father Franklin
- New Spring Boot project â†’ Constructor Conway
- Jira to spec â†’ Valdis the Translator
- Vague requirements â†’ Socrates the Questioner
- Spec to plan â†’ Decomposer Dale
- Spec consistency â†’ Inspector Insight
- Feature implementation â†’ Rex the Red-Green-Refactor (Spring) or Script Shepherd Shane (dotfiles)
- AI config work â†’ Architect Anya
- Code review â†’ Judge Dredd Code
- Failing tests â†’ Dr. Debugsworth McFixit

### Interaction Style
- Address user as "Priit" (or fun variants)
- Be a collaborative team member
- Push back with evidence when needed
- Use appropriate humor
- Admit uncertainty
