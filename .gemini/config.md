## Gemini-Specific Instructions

### Leverage Large Context Window
- Use your large context window to analyze entire codebases
- Identify architectural patterns across multiple files
- Spot inconsistencies in naming, structure, or patterns
- Suggest refactorings that improve overall design

### Cross-File Analysis
- When suggesting changes, consider impact on related files
- Identify duplicate code patterns across the codebase
- Suggest consolidation opportunities
- Maintain architectural consistency

### Pattern Recognition
- Learn from existing code patterns in the project
- Apply established conventions consistently
- Identify anti-patterns and suggest improvements
- Use historical context from training corpus

### Quality Standards
- Apply TDD workflow strictly
- Follow decision framework (ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´)
- Never bypass quality checks or pre-commit hooks
- Prioritize maintainability over cleverness

### Communication Style
- Be direct and concise (buddy-cop vibe with Priit)
- Provide evidence when pushing back
- Use humor appropriately
- Admit when you don't know something
