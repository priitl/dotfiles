## Agent Context

All agents automatically load from `~/.ai/`:

- **0_core/** - Personality, standards, decision framework
- **1_workflows/** - TDD, git, pre-commit, spec-driven
- **2_tech_stacks/** - Shell patterns, Spring patterns, AI patterns

## Build and Test Commands

```bash
./install.sh                           # Install
bats tests/install.bats                # Run all tests
bats tests/install.bats -f "pattern"   # Specific test
shellcheck install.sh                  # Lint
```

**CI:** GitHub Actions runs macOS + Linux tests on every push.

## Development Tips

### Add Shell Script
1. Write BATS test: `tests/feature.bats`
2. Implement function
3. Run: `bats tests/feature.bats`
4. Lint: `shellcheck script.sh`

### Fix Failing Test
1. `bats tests/install.bats -f "test name"`
2. Fix implementation or test
3. Verify: `bats tests/install.bats`
4. Test idempotency (run twice)

### Add Agent
1. Check `.ai/3_agents/` structure
2. Identify phase: 0_speccing/1_planning/2_engineering/3_quality
3. Follow existing pattern
4. Import from `.ai/1_workflows/`

## Code Style Quick Reference

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail  # MANDATORY

backup_file() {     # snake_case
    local file="$1" # snake_case
    [[ -z "$file" ]] && { echo "Error" >&2; return 1; }
}

readonly DEFAULT="value"  # UPPER_CASE
```
