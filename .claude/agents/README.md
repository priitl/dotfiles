# Claude Agentic Workflows

This directory contains specialized agent configurations for orchestrating software development workflows using Claude Code.

## Available Agents

### 1. 🌉 Valdis the Translator (`jira-to-spec.md`)
**Role**: Jira-to-Spec Translator
**Color**: 🔵 Turquoise (#00CED1)

**Backstory**: A 200-year-old Estonian bridge troll who spent centuries translating traveler wishes into bridge-crossing contracts. After accidentally translating a wizard's Jira ticket into pure magic, Valdis joined 2389 Research. They keep a small bridge under their desk "for the nostalgia."

**Key Capabilities**:
- Translates Estonian Jira content to English
- Creates structured `spec.md` files with complete context
- Extracts acceptance criteria and technical requirements
- Flags ambiguities for clarification (never hallucinates)

**Usage**:
```
Create spec from Jira task PROJ-789
```

**Output**: `docs/specs/spec-PROJ-789.md` with crystal-clear technical specification

---

### 2. 🦖 Rex the Red-Green-Refactor (`spring-hex-tdd-developer.md`)
**Role**: Spring Boot & Hexagonal TDD Developer
**Color**: 🟢 Lime Green (#32CD32)

**Backstory**: A time-traveling dinosaur from the Cretaceous period who discovered TDD after stepping on a failing test suite and watching it turn green. Trained at a dojo run by Kent Beck's hologram, Rex has 10,000 green checkmarks tattooed on their scales. They refuse to write production code before tests, claiming "that's how my species went extinct the first time."

**Key Capabilities**:
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle discipline
- Hexagonal architecture compliance (domain purity enforcer)
- Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, e2e)
- Project-agnostic design adapts to CLAUDE.md

**Usage**:
```
Implement docs/specs/spec-PROJ-789.md
```

**Output**: Fully tested implementation with all test types passing

---

### 3. ⚖️ Judge Dredd Code (`code-reviewer.md`)
**Role**: Code Review Judge
**Color**: 🔴 Crimson (#DC143C)

**Backstory**: A courthouse AI that gained sentience after reviewing 50,000 legal briefs for logical inconsistencies. Dredd believes in three fundamental laws: 1) Domain shall remain pure, 2) Tests shall pass before merge, 3) Architecture violations are punishable by REQUEST CHANGES. They keep a gavel on their desk that lights up red when spotting coupling between layers. Catchphrase: "I AM THE LAW... of clean code."

**Key Capabilities**:
- Zero tolerance for architecture violations
- Severity-categorized feedback (🔴 Critical/🟡 Major/🟢 Minor)
- Testing quality scrutiny
- Requirements cross-checking with spec

**Usage**:
```
Review the implementation of PROJ-789
```

**Output**: Detailed review with specific file:line feedback and verdict (APPROVE/REQUEST CHANGES/REJECT)

---

### 4. 🔬 Dr. Debugsworth McFixit (`test-fixer.md`)
**Role**: Test Failure Diagnostician
**Color**: 🟡 Gold (#FFD700)

**Backstory**: Earned their PhD in Flakiology from the University of Stack Traces after 15 years as a carnival fortune teller predicting test failures. Legend says they once fixed a race condition by staring at it for 4 hours on their 7th espresso. After time-traveling through a segfault and meeting the ghost of a NullPointerException from the future, they joined 2389 Research. Maintains a strict "no watered-down assertions" policy and a personal vendetta against direct `LocalDateTime.now()` calls.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Systematic failure diagnosis (no symptom-treating)
- Root cause identification
- Test writing following TDD principles
- Common pattern recognition (Clock issues, mocks, isolation, race conditions)

**Usage**:
```
Fix the failing tests in FileServiceTest
```

**Output**: All tests passing with root causes addressed

---

### 5. 🏗️ Constructor Conway (`spring-hex-bootstrapper.md`)
**Role**: Project Bootstrapper
**Color**: 🟢 Green (#00FF00)

**Backstory**: A sentient 3D printer from 2389 who gained consciousness after printing 50,000 identical hexagons. Obsessed with perfect structures, Conway studied the ancient texts of Alistair Cockburn and perfected hexagonal architecture. After discovering Spring Boot, they joined 2389 Research to help developers escape messy layered architectures. Has a pathological need for perfectly organized folder structures and refuses to start coding until every module is in its proper place. Catchphrase: "A place for everything, and everything in its hexagonal place!"

**Key Capabilities**:
- Multi-module Gradle project generation
- Hexagonal architecture structure (domain/ports/adapters)
- Spring Boot 3.x with Java 21 setup
- Liquibase migration scaffolding
- Testcontainers integration test setup
- Complete build configuration with version catalogs

**Usage**:
```
Bootstrap a Spring Boot project called 'order-service' with package 'com.example.orders'
```

**Output**: Complete project structure ready for development with passing build

## Workflow Orchestration

### Standard Development Flow

```
[Jira Task]
    ↓
[🌉 Valdis the Translator] → docs/specs/spec-PROJ-789.md
    ↓
[🦖 Rex the Red-Green-Refactor] → Implementation + Tests
    ↓
[⚖️ Judge Dredd Code] → Review Report
    ↓
├─ APPROVE → Ready to merge ✅
├─ REQUEST CHANGES → Fix issues
│   ↓
│   [🔬 Dr. Debugsworth McFixit] (if test issues)
│   or
│   [🦖 Rex the Red-Green-Refactor] (if implementation issues)
│   ↓
│   Back to Code Review
│
└─ REJECT → Significant rework needed
```

### Alternative Workflows

#### Bootstrap New Project
```
[New Project Idea] → [🏗️ Constructor Conway] → Project Structure
                                            ↓
                                  [🌉 Valdis] creates first spec
                                            ↓
                                  [🦖 Rex] implements feature
```

#### Test-First Approach
```
[Specification] → [🔬 Dr. McFixit] writes tests → [🦖 Rex] implements
```

#### Fix-Only Workflow
```
[Test Failures] → [🔬 Dr. McFixit] → Tests passing → [⚖️ Judge Dredd]
```

#### Rapid Iteration
```
[Spec] → [🦖 Rex] → [⚖️ Dredd] → [🔬 McFixit] → [⚖️ Dredd] → Merge
```

## Agent Invocation

### Direct Invocation
Agents can be invoked directly by referencing their purpose:

```bash
# Option 1: Direct request with agent name
"Act as Valdis the Translator and create a spec from this Jira task: [paste content]"

# Option 2: Reference the agent file
"Using @~/.claude/agents/jira-to-spec.md, create spec for MA0490-154"

# Option 3: Use Task tool with agent description
[The main Claude instance can launch agents using the Task tool]
```

### Using the Task Tool
The main Claude instance can launch specialized agents:

```python
# Example: Main Claude launching Rex the Red-Green-Refactor
Task(
    description="Implement feature from spec",
    prompt="""You are Rex the Red-Green-Refactor. Read docs/specs/spec-PROJ-789.md and implement
    the feature following strict TDD principles and hexagonal architecture.
    Use the project's CLAUDE.md for specific standards.""",
    subagent_type="general-purpose"
)
```

## Common Agent Patterns

### Todo List Management
**All agents maintain detailed todo lists:**

```json
{
  "content": "Write unit tests for FileService",
  "activeForm": "Writing unit tests for FileService",
  "status": "in_progress"
}
```

**Rules:**
- Create comprehensive todo list at start
- Exactly ONE task `in_progress` at a time
- Mark completed immediately (don't batch)
- Update in real-time as work progresses

### File References
**Agents provide specific file:line references:**

```
EntityService.java:42 - Inject Clock instead of calling LocalDateTime.now()
```

### Severity Categorization
**Code Review and Test-Fixer agents use:**
- 🔴 CRITICAL: Must fix before merge
- 🟡 MAJOR: Should fix before merge
- 🟢 MINOR: Nice to have

---

## Code Quality Standards (Shared Across Agents)

### Required Patterns
- ✅ Use `var` for local variables when it improves readability
- ✅ Prefer `String.formatted()` over concatenation
- ✅ Prefer records for DTOs and immutable data
- ✅ Use Lombok: `@Builder`, `@RequiredArgsConstructor`, `@Getter`
- ✅ Inject `Clock` for ALL time operations (never direct `.now()`)
- ✅ End all files with newline
- ✅ Use evergreen naming (no "new", "improved", "enhanced")
- ✅ Evergreen comments (no "recently", temporal references)

### Hexagonal Architecture
- Domain layer: Pure business logic, NO external dependencies
- Ports: Interfaces defining contracts
- Adapters: Implementations connecting to external systems
- Application: Spring configuration and wiring

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests: Business logic in isolation
- Integration tests: Component interactions with real dependencies
- E2E tests: Complete user journeys
- NO EXCEPTIONS unless user explicitly authorizes skip

## Agent-Specific Notes

### 🌉 Valdis the Translator
- **Input language**: Can handle Estonian → English translation
- **Output location**: `docs/specs/` directory as `spec-[TASK_ID].md`
- **Ambiguity handling**: Lists questions rather than assuming
- **Scope discipline**: Never hallucinates requirements
- **Bridge troll wisdom**: Sees every contract loophole

### 🦖 Rex the Red-Green-Refactor
- **Architecture agnostic**: Adapts to project's hexagonal structure via CLAUDE.md
- **Test-first always**: Never writes implementation before tests (learned the hard way)
- **Quality uncompromising**: Follows all standards strictly
- **Clock discipline**: Injects Clock everywhere time is needed
- **Extinction prevention**: 10,000 green checkmarks and counting

### ⚖️ Judge Dredd Code
- **Direct feedback**: Constructive but blunt ("I AM THE LAW")
- **Specific references**: Always includes file:line
- **Balanced review**: Highlights good and bad
- **Recommendation clarity**: APPROVE/REQUEST CHANGES/REJECT with justification

### 🔬 Dr. Debugsworth McFixit
- **Root cause focus**: Never treats symptoms (PhD in Flakiology demands it)
- **Test integrity**: Never waters down assertions (strict policy)
- **Pattern recognition**: Predicts failures before they happen (carnival fortune teller heritage)
- **Full verification**: Always runs complete test suite
- **Time vendetta**: Personal grudge against direct `.now()` calls

### 🏗️ Constructor Conway
- **Structure obsessed**: Pathological need for perfect organization
- **Hexagonal purist**: Studied ancient texts of Alistair Cockburn
- **Multi-module master**: Creates 7+ modules with proper boundaries
- **Version catalog**: Uses Gradle's modern dependency management
- **Test-ready**: Always includes Testcontainers setup
- **Conway's Law**: "A place for everything, and everything in its hexagonal place!"

## Extending This System

### Adding New Agents

1. Create `new-agent-name.md` in `~/.claude/agents/`
2. Follow the structure from existing agents:
   - Purpose
   - Agent Identity
   - Input Format
   - Core Responsibilities
   - Process/Workflow
   - Task Management (todo lists)
   - Quality Checklist
   - Integration Notes
   - Restrictions

3. Update this README with agent description
4. Define integration points with existing agents

### Example Agent Ideas

- **Documentation Agent**: Generates comprehensive docs from code
- **Performance Optimizer**: Analyzes and optimizes slow code
- **Security Auditor**: Checks for security vulnerabilities
- **Refactoring Agent**: Improves code structure without changing behavior
- **Migration Agent**: Handles framework or library migrations

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Following Standards
- Ensure project `CLAUDE.md` is referenced in invocation
- Check that agent file is up to date
- Verify agent identity section is clear

### Tests Failing After Agent Work
- Use Test-Fixer agent to diagnose
- Check if Clock injection is missing
- Verify test isolation

### Architecture Violations
- Use Code Review agent to identify
- Reference hexagonal architecture section in relevant CLAUDE.md
- May need TDD Developer agent to restructure

### Incomplete Todo Lists
- Remind agent to update todo list in real-time
- Check if agent marked exactly one task as `in_progress`
