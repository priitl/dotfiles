# Tech Stack: AI Configuration Systems

## Overview
AI configuration repositories for managing agent definitions, workflow patterns, and AI tool settings across multiple platforms (Claude Code, Copilot, Gemini, Cursor). Emphasizes agent-agnostic design, modularity, and Unix philosophy applied to AI configurations.

## Architecture Patterns

### Configuration Layers
Agent-agnostic, composable configuration system:

```
.ai/
â”œâ”€â”€ 0_core/                 # Foundational patterns (cross-cutting concerns)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ priit-personality.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ coding-standards.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ decision-framework.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ git-workflow.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tech-stack-*.md
â”œâ”€â”€ 1_workflows/            # Reusable workflow patterns
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tdd-workflow.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pre-commit-protocol.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ spec-driven-workflow.md
â”œâ”€â”€ 3_agents/               # Specialized agent definitions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 0_speccing/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 1_planning/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 2_engineering/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 3_quality/
â””â”€â”€ 4_specs/                # Specification templates
    â”œâ”€â”€ spec-template.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ plan-template.md
    â””â”€â”€ tasks-template.md
```

### Unix Philosophy Applied to AI Configs
- **Do one thing well**: Each agent has single, clear responsibility
- **Composability**: Agents and workflows can be combined
- **Plain text**: All configs are markdown (readable, version-controlled)
- **Modularity**: Separate concerns into discrete files

## Agent Definition Standards

### Agent File Structure
```markdown
---
name: "Agent Name"
description: "Clear, concise description"
color: "#HEXCODE"
tools: ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "TodoWrite"]
backstory: |
  Memorable, personality-driven origin story
---

# Agent Title

## Purpose
## Agent Identity
## Input Format
## Core Responsibilities
## Implementation Process
## Task Management
## Quality Checklist
## Integration Notes
## Restrictions
```

### Agent Design Principles
1. **Single Responsibility**: One agent, one clear focus
2. **Agent-Agnostic**: No tool-specific commands (works across Claude/Copilot/Gemini)
3. **Memorable Backstory**: Personality-driven, explains agent's approach
4. **Clear Boundaries**: Explicit integration points with other agents
5. **Strong Language**: Use NEVER/ALWAYS for restrictions

### Frontmatter Requirements
- **name**: Memorable character name (e.g., "Rex the Red-Green-Refactor")
- **description**: One-line specialty description
- **color**: Hex color for visual identification
- **tools**: Array of available tools (Claude Code specific, optional for others)
- **backstory**: Character origin story (explains values and approach)

## Workflow Patterns

### Spec-Driven Development Workflow
```
TRANSLATE â†’ PLAN â†’ BUILD â†’ VERIFY

Valdis         Decomposer Dale    Builder Agents    Judge Dredd
(spec.md)   â†’  (plan.md/tasks.md) â†’ (implementation) â†’ (review)
```

### Agent Categorization
- **0_speccing**: Requirements â†’ Specifications
- **1_planning**: Specifications â†’ Implementation Plans
- **2_engineering**: Implementation Plans â†’ Code
- **3_quality**: Code â†’ Review/Fixes

## Configuration Management

### Core Patterns (0_core/)
Foundational, cross-cutting concerns shared across all contexts:
- **Personality**: Base communication style and values
- **Coding standards**: Universal code quality rules
- **Decision framework**: How to make technical decisions (ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´)
- **Git workflow**: Version control practices
- **Tech stacks**: Technology-specific patterns

### Workflow Patterns (1_workflows/)
Reusable process patterns:
- **TDD workflow**: Test-Driven Development process
- **Pre-commit protocol**: Pre-commit hook requirements
- **Spec-driven workflow**: Specification-first development

### Agent Definitions (3_agents/)
Specialized agent implementations:
- Each agent focuses on ONE specific responsibility
- Agents compose workflows and core patterns via @import
- Clear integration points between agents
- Organized by workflow phase (speccing/planning/engineering/quality)

### Templates (4_specs/)
Project specification templates:
- **spec-template.md**: Technical specification format
- **plan-template.md**: Implementation plan format
- **tasks-template.md**: Task breakdown format

**Note:** Project documentation (constitution.md, AGENTS.md, guidelines.md) is generated by **Archivist Aurora** agent, not via manual templates.

## Agent-Agnostic Language

### DO Use:
```markdown
- "Read the file at path/to/file.java"
- "Create a new file with the following content"
- "Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle"
- "Verify all tests pass"
- "Run shellcheck to validate scripts"
```

### DON'T Use:
```markdown
- "Use the Read tool to read path/to/file.java"
- "Run `cat path/to/file.java`"
- "Execute the Bash tool with command 'mvn test'"
- Tool-specific instructions
- Platform-specific commands in generic context
```

## Backstory Guidelines

### Effective Backstories
Create memorable, personality-driven backstories that:
- **Explain WHY**: Why the agent has specific values
- **Make memorable**: Unique character that sticks in mind
- **Add humor**: Quirky but professional
- **Connect to domain**: Relates to agent's expertise
- **Include motto**: Catchphrase that captures philosophy

### Backstory Examples
- **Rex**: Time-traveling dinosaur who discovered TDD, refuses to write code before tests
- **Valdis**: Bridge troll who spent 200 years translating wishes into contracts
- **Dale**: Project manager who built a cathedral without planning (disaster)
- **Shane**: Scottish shepherd who realizes dotfiles need same care as sheep

## Quality Standards

### Agent Quality Checklist
- [ ] Frontmatter includes all fields (name, description, color, tools, backstory)
- [ ] Purpose statement is clear and focused
- [ ] Agent identity defines personality and approach
- [ ] Input/output formats clearly specified
- [ ] Core responsibilities numbered and actionable
- [ ] Implementation process broken into phases
- [ ] Task management section with TodoWrite requirements
- [ ] Quality checklist provided
- [ ] Integration notes explain workflow position
- [ ] Restrictions use strong "NEVER/ALWAYS" language
- [ ] Backstory is memorable and relevant
- [ ] Language is agent-agnostic (no tool-specific commands)
- [ ] No duplication with existing agents/patterns
- [ ] README.md updated when adding agents

### Configuration Best Practices
- **DRY Principle**: Extract shared patterns to 0_core/, use @import
- **Single Source of Truth**: Each concern defined once
- **Evergreen Language**: No "recently", "new", "modern" (code ages)
- **Strong Restrictions**: Use absolute language (NEVER/ALWAYS)
- **Clear Boundaries**: Explicit agent handoff protocols

## Tech Stack Context Files

### Purpose
Provide technology-specific patterns for planning and implementation without hardcoding into agents.

### Structure
Each `tech-stack-{name}.md` file contains:
- **Architecture patterns**: Layering, component structure
- **Testing frameworks**: Unit, integration, e2e test tools
- **Conventions**: Naming, file organization, idioms
- **Common components**: Typical building blocks
- **Best practices**: Tech-specific quality standards
- **Code examples**: Canonical patterns

### Available Tech Stacks
- `tech-stack-spring.md`: Spring Boot, Hexagonal Architecture
- `tech-stack-dotfiles.md`: Shell scripts, BATS testing
- `tech-stack-ai.md`: AI configuration systems (this file)

### Adding New Tech Stacks
1. Create `.ai/2_tech_stacks/tech-stack-{name}.md`
2. Document architecture, testing, conventions
3. Provide code examples and patterns
4. Add to project's `constitution.md`: `tech_stack: {name}`
5. Decomposer Dale auto-loads during planning

## Planning Considerations

### When Planning AI Configuration Features
1. **Agent vs. Workflow**: Should this be a new agent or a workflow pattern?
2. **Category**: Which folder (0_core, 1_workflows, 2_agents, 3_specs)?
3. **Scope**: Single, clear responsibility or too broad?
4. **Duplication**: Does similar pattern already exist?
5. **Integration**: How does this fit in the workflow (Translate/Plan/Build/Verify)?
6. **Agent-agnostic**: Can this work across Claude/Copilot/Gemini?

### Task Breakdown Pattern
1. **T1-T2**: Design agent/workflow structure (frontmatter, sections)
2. **T3-T4**: Write backstory and purpose
3. **T5-T7**: Document core responsibilities and process
4. **T8-T9**: Add quality checklist and restrictions
5. **T10**: Write integration notes
6. **T11**: Update README.md
7. **T12**: Verify agent-agnostic language
8. **T13**: Test with target AI platforms

### Common Task Types
- Create new agent definition in `3_agents/`
- Create new workflow pattern in `1_workflows/`
- Create new core pattern in `0_core/`
- Update agent category README.md
- Add integration notes between agents
- Refactor shared patterns to reduce duplication

## Directory Structure Conventions

### Naming Conventions
- **Folders**: `0_category/`, `1_category/` (numbered for ordering)
- **Agent files**: `agent-name.md` (kebab-case)
- **Workflow files**: `workflow-name.md` (kebab-case)
- **Core files**: `pattern-name.md` (kebab-case)

### README Files
Each category folder must have README.md:
- List of agents/patterns in that category
- When to use each one
- Invocation examples
- Brief backstory/description

## Integration with AI Tools

### Claude Code
- Uses Task tool to delegate to agents
- TodoWrite for task management
- Full tool access (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, etc.)

### GitHub Copilot
- Agents available as context patterns
- Reference in comments/prompts
- No direct tool invocation

### Gemini/Cursor
- Import agent specifications
- Reference in workflow prompts
- Adapt to tool capabilities

## Best Practices

### Maintainability
- **Small, focused agents**: Each does one thing well
- **Clear separation**: 0_core vs 1_workflows vs 2_agents
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Every agent has examples
- **Version control everything**: All configs in git

### Portability
- **Agent-agnostic language**: Works across platforms
- **No hardcoded paths**: Use relative references
- **Platform adaptations**: Document tool-specific notes separately

### Evolution
- **Refactor duplication**: Move shared patterns to 0_core
- **Update documentation**: Keep READMEs current
- **Test across platforms**: Verify with multiple AI tools
- **Gather feedback**: Improve based on actual usage
