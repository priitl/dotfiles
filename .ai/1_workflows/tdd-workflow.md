# TDD Workflow

## We practice TDD. That means:

- Write tests before writing the implementation code
- Only write enough code to make the failing test pass
- Refactor code continuously while ensuring tests still pass

## TDD Implementation Process

1. Write a failing test that defines a desired function or improvement
2. Run the test to confirm it fails as expected
3. Write minimal code to make the test pass
4. Run the test to confirm success
5. Refactor code to improve design while keeping tests green
6. Repeat the cycle for each new feature or bugfix
