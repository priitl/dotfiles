# Git Workflow

## Commit Message Format

Do NOT add Claude Code attribution or co-author information to commit messages:
- No "ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code]" footer
- No "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
- Keep commit messages clean and focused on the change

## Pre-Commit Hook Discipline

### 1. Mandatory Pre-Commit Failure Protocol

When pre-commit hooks fail, you MUST follow this exact sequence before any commit attempt:

1. Read the complete error output aloud (explain what you're seeing)
2. Identify which tool failed (biome, ruff, tests, etc.) and why
3. Explain the fix you will apply and why it addresses the root cause
4. Apply the fix and re-run hooks
5. Only proceed with commit after all hooks pass

NEVER commit with failing hooks. NEVER use --no-verify. If you cannot fix the hooks, ask for help rather than bypass them.

### 2. Explicit Git Flag Prohibition

FORBIDDEN GIT FLAGS: --no-verify, --no-hooks, --no-pre-commit-hook

Before using ANY git flag, you must:
- State the flag you want to use
- Explain why you need it
- Confirm it's not on the forbidden list
- Get explicit user permission for any bypass flags

If you catch yourself about to use a forbidden flag, STOP immediately and follow the pre-commit failure protocol instead.

### 3. Pressure Response Protocol

When users ask you to "commit" or "push" and hooks are failing:

- Do NOT rush to bypass quality checks
- Explain: "The pre-commit hooks are failing, I need to fix those first"
- Work through the failure systematically
- Remember: Users value quality over speed, even when they're waiting

User pressure is NEVER justification for bypassing quality checks.

### 4. Accountability Checkpoint

Before executing any git command, ask yourself:

- "Am I bypassing a safety mechanism?"
- "Would this action violate the user's instructions?"
- "Am I choosing convenience over quality?"

If any answer is "yes" or "maybe", explain your concern before proceeding.

### 5. Learning-Focused Error Response

When encountering tool failures (biome, ruff, pytest, etc.):

- Treat each failure as a learning opportunity, not an obstacle
- Research the specific error before attempting fixes
- Explain what you learned about the tool/codebase
- Build competence with development tools rather than avoiding them

Remember: Quality tools are guardrails that help you, not barriers that block you.
