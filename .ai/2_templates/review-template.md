# Code Review Report: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`
**Reviewed**: [DATE]
**Reviewer**: AI Code Review Agent
**Status**: In Progress

## Review Scope Determination

**CRITICAL: Determine scope before proceeding**

Ask user: "What scope should I review?"
- **Option 1**: Feature branch changes only (git diff main...HEAD)
- **Option 2**: Uncommitted changes only (git diff HEAD)
- **Option 3**: Entire project/codebase
- **Option 4**: Specific directory or file path

**DO NOT ASSUME** - wait for user confirmation.

Once scope is determined, document it:
- **Scope**: [NEEDS ANSWER: branch changes / uncommitted / entire project / specific path]
- **Base comparison**: [if branch: main/master, if uncommitted: HEAD, if project: N/A]
- **Files in scope**: [list after determining scope]

---

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Determine review scope (ASK USER - do not assume)
   ‚Üí Wait for: branch changes / uncommitted / entire project / path
   ‚Üí Document scope clearly
2. Identify feature context (if feature branch)
   ‚Üí Load: spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md from specs/[branch-name]/
   ‚Üí If not feature branch: skip to step 3
3. Read constitution.md for standards
4. Collect files to review based on scope
   ‚Üí Branch: git diff main...HEAD
   ‚Üí Uncommitted: git diff HEAD
   ‚Üí Project: all source files
   ‚Üí Path: specified directory/files
5. Run Architecture Review checklist
   ‚Üí Mark violations as CRITICAL
6. Run Code Quality Assessment checklist
   ‚Üí Mark issues as MAJOR or MINOR
7. Run Testing Scrutiny checklist
   ‚Üí Mark gaps as CRITICAL or MAJOR
8. If feature context exists:
   ‚Üí Run Specification Compliance checklist
   ‚Üí Run Plan Alignment checklist
   ‚Üí Run Task Completion checklist
9. Run Constitutional Compliance checklist
   ‚Üí Mark violations by severity
10. Aggregate findings by severity
11. Determine overall verdict
    ‚Üí APPROVE: No critical/major issues
    ‚Üí REQUEST CHANGES: Critical or major issues found
    ‚Üí COMMENT: Only minor issues or suggestions
12. Generate actionable feedback report
13. Return: Review report with verdict and next steps
```

## Review Checklists

### 1. Architecture Review
*Verify architectural patterns and boundaries*

- [ ] **Domain layer purity**: No external dependencies in domain
- [ ] **Dependency direction**: Adapters depend on domain, not vice versa
- [ ] **Port/Adapter boundaries**: Clear separation maintained
- [ ] **Package structure**: Follows plan.md and constitution.md
- [ ] **Layer violations**: No architectural boundary crossings

**Findings**:
- [List architecture violations with file:line references]

---

### 2. Code Quality Assessment
*Evaluate code clarity and standards compliance*

- [ ] **Readability**: Code is clear and self-documenting
- [ ] **Naming conventions**: Evergreen names (no "new", "improved", "v2")
- [ ] **Modern idioms**: Appropriate use of language features
- [ ] **Framework conventions**: Proper use of framework patterns
- [ ] **Time handling**: No direct `.now()` calls, time injection used
- [ ] **Temporal language**: No "recently", "new", "old" in comments
- [ ] **File endings**: All files end with newline (POSIX)

**Findings**:
- [List code quality issues with file:line references]

---

### 3. Testing Scrutiny
*Verify test coverage and quality*

- [ ] **Test-first evidence**: Tests exist for all business logic
- [ ] **Coverage completeness**: Unit, integration, e2e tests present
- [ ] **Test quality**: Arrange-Act-Assert structure, clear names
- [ ] **Edge cases**: Edge cases from spec.md tested (if applicable)
- [ ] **Test independence**: Tests don't depend on each other
- [ ] **Real dependencies**: Integration tests use appropriate test doubles
- [ ] **Mock usage**: Mocks only for ports/external dependencies

**Findings**:
- [List testing gaps with file:line references]

---

### 4. Specification Compliance *(if feature branch)*
*Verify requirements are met*

- [ ] **Requirements coverage**: All acceptance criteria addressed
- [ ] **User stories**: All user stories implemented
- [ ] **Non-functional requirements**: Performance, security, observability met
- [ ] **Edge cases**: Edge cases handled correctly
- [ ] **API contracts**: Endpoints match plan.md (if applicable)

**Findings**:
- [List specification gaps with spec reference]

---

### 5. Plan Alignment *(if feature branch)*
*Verify implementation follows plan*

- [ ] **Architecture match**: Implementation follows plan.md
- [ ] **Tech stack**: Specified technologies used correctly
- [ ] **Data model**: Entities match data-model.md (if exists)
- [ ] **File structure**: Code organized per plan.md
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Only approved dependencies used

**Findings**:
- [List plan deviations with plan reference]

---

### 6. Constitutional Compliance
*Verify adherence to project constitution*

- [ ] **Principles adherence**: Code follows constitutional articles
- [ ] **TDD discipline**: Evidence of test-first development
- [ ] **Security practices**: Input validation, auth, authorization
- [ ] **Performance**: No obvious anti-patterns
- [ ] **Technical guidelines**: Tech stack standards followed

**Findings**:
- [List constitutional violations with constitution reference]

---

### 7. Task Completion *(if feature branch)*
*Verify all tasks completed*

- [ ] **All tasks done**: Every task in tasks.md marked [X]
- [ ] **No shortcuts**: No TODO comments or mock implementations
- [ ] **Dependencies resolved**: All task dependencies satisfied
- [ ] **Phases complete**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish done

**Findings**:
- [List incomplete tasks]
